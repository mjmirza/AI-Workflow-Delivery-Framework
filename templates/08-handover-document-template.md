## 8. Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### 8.1 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Workflow Not Triggering

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Workflow inactive | Check toggle is ON (green) in n8n |
| Webhook URL changed | Verify webhook URL in triggering system |
| Cron schedule wrong | Check schedule settings in trigger node |
| n8n server down | Check server status, restart if needed |

#### Issue: Authentication/Credential Errors

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Token expired | Re-authenticate the credential |
| Password changed | Update credential with new password |
| API key revoked | Generate new API key, update credential |
| Insufficient permissions | Check service account permissions |

#### Issue: Workflow Errors/Failures

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Rate limit exceeded | Wait and retry, or reduce frequency |
| Invalid data received | Check input data format |
| Service temporarily down | Wait and retry, check service status |
| Node configuration changed | Review node settings, compare to backup |

#### Issue: Slow Performance

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Large data processing | Consider batching or splitting |
| External API slow | Check service status |
| Too many executions | Review concurrent execution limits |

### 8.2 Quick Fixes Reference

| Symptom | First Try | If That Fails |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Workflow stopped | Toggle OFF then ON | Check execution log |
| Credential error | Re-authenticate | Check API key validity |
| Wrong output | Check input data | Review node logic |
| Timeout error | Increase timeout setting | Split into smaller workflows |
| Duplicate runs | Check trigger conditions | Add deduplication logic |

### Common Objections & Responses

```
OBJECTION: "The price is too high"
RESPONSE:
"I understand budget is a consideration. Let me ask -
what were you expecting to invest? And what would happen
if you don't solve this problem? [Pause] Often when we
break down the ROI, clients find the investment pays for
itself in [X months]. Would it help to look at the numbers?"

Alternative: "We could adjust scope to fit your budget.
What's most critical to solve right now?"

─────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTION: "I need to think about it"
RESPONSE:
"Of course. What specifically do you want to think through?
Is it the solution approach, the pricing, or something else?
[Address specific concern] When do you think you'll have
a decision? I'll follow up then."

─────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTION: "I need to discuss with my team"
RESPONSE:
"Absolutely. Who else is involved in this decision?
Would it be helpful if I joined a call to answer their
questions directly? Or I can prepare materials for you
to share. What would work best?"

─────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTION: "What about [Competitor]?"
RESPONSE:
"They do good work. The key difference is [differentiator].
Our clients typically choose us because [reason].
What's most important to you in making this decision?"

─────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTION: "Can you do it faster?"
RESPONSE:
"I want to deliver quality work. Rushing often leads to
issues. However, if timeline is critical, we can discuss
rush options - there would be a premium for the accelerated
schedule. What's driving the timeline?"
